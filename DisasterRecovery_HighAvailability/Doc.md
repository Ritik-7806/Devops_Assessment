☁️ Disaster Recovery & High Availability Strategy
✅ Objective
Design a backup and disaster recovery (DR) strategy for a cloud-based enterprise application hosted in Microsoft Azure, ensuring high availability (HA) and minimal downtime in the event of system failure or data loss.

📄 DR Strategy Document
1. 🔄 Overview
   A disaster recovery strategy ensures that mission-critical services can recover quickly from any unplanned outages — be it system failure, accidental deletion, ransomware attacks, or full-region outages. The approach must align with business continuity goals and regulatory requirements.

2. 📊 Key Metrics
   Term	Description
   RTO (Recovery Time Objective)	Maximum tolerable time to restore services after an incident.
   RPO (Recovery Point Objective)	Maximum acceptable amount of data loss measured in time.
   For this application:

RTO: 1 hour

RPO: 15 minutes

3. ☁️ Backup Strategy in Azure
   Azure Backup will be used to protect virtual machines, databases, and app configuration files.

Geo-redundant storage (GRS) ensures that backup data is replicated across regions.

Daily and weekly backup policies will be configured with long-term retention.

🛠️ What to back up:
Azure SQL Databases (daily point-in-time restore up to 35 days)

Azure Blob Storage (soft delete + lifecycle management)

Azure Virtual Machines (full VM snapshot backup using Azure Recovery Services Vault)

4. 🌍 High Availability Architecture
   Multi-region deployment using Azure Traffic Manager for intelligent routing.

Use of Availability Zones to distribute VMs and services across physically separate locations within a region.

Stateless services will be deployed in multiple regions with active-active or active-passive modes.

State-full services (like databases) will use Azure’s native geo-replication.

5. 🧪 Disaster Recovery Plan
   Step	Action
   1	Detect failure via monitoring alerts (Azure Monitor, Log Analytics)
   2	Automatically failover to secondary region using Traffic Manager
   3	Restore latest backups if data loss occurred
   4	Validate application functionality post-restore
   5	Root cause analysis and full incident documentation

📌 Summary
   With a structured DR plan, well-defined RTO/RPO targets, and automated backup in place, this approach ensures enterprise-grade resilience and business continuity for any critical cloud-based system hosted on Azure.
